            <h1>A Notification System for TAMs</h1>
            <p>
                This past summer, I worked as a UI Developer intern at <a class="link" href="https://vailsys.com">Vail Systems, Inc.</a>, a telephony company based in Chicago. 
                The project I worked on is called Valert - it is a notification system for Technical Account Managers (TAMs) that triggers email 
                and SMS alerts when data-specific thresholds in call centers are passed. For example, if a TAM wanted to be notified when 
                a certain company's call traffic rose to 500 calls per second, they could easily create a “rule” that allows them to customize 
                these notifications.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h1>Need for User-Friendliness</h1>
            <p>
                Before Valert, Vail would create rules using a CDR listener application called Trunkmon. Since Trunkmon required more technical experience, 
                TAMs would have to speak with a manager, who would then create a ticket for operations, which would then need to be approved and reviewed. 
                This process would take a few days, and was not the most user-friendly towards TAMs. Furthermore, if a TAM wanted to change or delete a rule
                at a later point, they would have to go through this whole process again.
                There was an apparent need for a more efficient solution that would allow TAMs to easily create rules with no technical experience.

            <h1>Organizing the Initial Layout</h1>
            <p>
                At the start of the internship, I received a list of required features and pages from my manager. The project called for a table that displayed
                rules (which had the custom thresholds and notifications that TAMs inputted). Users should be able to create, read, update, and delete rules. Thus,
                a form (or "Rule Builder") was needed so that TAMs could create new rules and add them to the table.
                With this information, I created a preliminary user-flow.
            </p>

            <p><br>
                I then started working on what the basic layout of the product would look like.
                I knew the main page had to be a table of rules that were already in the system, but I needed to sketch options
                on what this "Rule Builder" would look like.
            </p>
            <img class="figure fullWidth" src="https://chelly-website.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/valert/sketches/01.JPG">
            <p>
                After sketching out some options, I created low-fidelity mockups in Figma for each one. I met with the Technical Account Manager assigned to our project
                and had him try out each prototype.<br>

            </div>
            <p><br>
                After some observation, it was apparent that the drop-down option was the most efficient - users would be able to click
                on a row in the table, and that row would expand down to display more detailed information on that particular entry. With this design, users could "open"
                multiple rows and view them all at once.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h1>Building the "Rule Builder</h1>
            After designing the initial layout of the application, I dove into more detail. With the requirements my manager gave me, 
            I had to narrow down what each field within the "Rule Builder" looked like. The user had to create a name and description for the rule,
            add a call threshold (ex. more than 500 calls per second), specify what phone number or email address they wanted to be notified with, what notification
            would look like, etc.
