                Finance Friend is a project I worked on as a front-end developer with three other students
                for a Human Computer Interaction Class. Finance Friend is a proof-of-concept web app
                that helps novice traders learn more about key financial concepts.
            </p>
        </section>

        <div class="section">
            <h1>Cryptocurrency Observations</h1>
            <p>
                To start the project, we searched for similar web apps that teach financial concepts. 
                We found a crytocurrency bot online and had non-developer students test it out. 
                The most common feedback was that although the interface was nice
                and simple, the bot was a "one-and-done" kind of site &mdash; users would not
                return to the website after looking through it once. They also stated that the content
                was not presented simply enough, and that they would not recommend it for people who have no
                prior knowledge of economics. From these observations, we determined that we needed to create 
                something that the user could return to, helping them grow in their financial knowledge.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h1>Incentivizing Features</h1>
            <p>
                After we conducting user observations, we determined our essential features. We wanted our site to be
                simple, since it would be teaching complex concepts. We also wanted to create a points
                system so that the user could track their learning progress. This would incentivize users
                to return to the web app instead of just visiting it once.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h1>"Paper Prototyping" Test</h1>
            <p>
                After we decided our features, I created a "paper prototype" to test on users while the rest of my team
                members facilitated the user testing. We printed each screen on a separate piece of physical paper and
                had a user "navigate" the site by clicking through it.
            </p>
            <div class="flexRow">
                <img class="figure-1/2" src="https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/chelly-website/website-images/fin-fr/paper-1.png">
                <img class="figure-1/2" src="https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/chelly-website/website-images/fin-fr/paper-2.png">
            </div>
            <p>
                During testing, we discovered that users prefer to pick their skill level after they have
                already made an account, rather than at the beginning of creating an account. We also found that
                the user wanted a home screen that they could come back to at the end of each lesson.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h1>Friendly Branding</h1>
            <p>
                As the name suggests, we wanted to design a logo that was friendly and approachable for users. Since I was in charged of branding, I chose a blue color as 
                a neutral value, for its familiarity and professional nature.
            </p>
            <div class="flexRow">
                <img class="figure-1/2" src="https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/chelly-website/website-images/fin-fr/logo-sketches.png">
            </div>
            <p>
                I chose a rounded font, again to not intimidate users. I also chose a light pink and blue - since the darker blue
                was more professional, I wanted more pastel colors to soften to look of the interface.
            </p>
            <div class="flexColumn">

        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h1>Computer Prototype</h1>
            <p>
                Once we had a color scheme and feedback from user testing, we started on the computer prototype.
                The class was structure so that the teams had a week to implement each feature. After each feature was implemented,
                we received feedback from the class TA and from other students in the class.
            </p>
            <h2 class="featureTitle">Feature 1: Learn About Key Terms</h2>
            <p>
                Once I had the color scheme, I started on the first feature. I created a "key terms" page which included a flash card and a list view of
                basic financial terms. The user could either learn with flashcards, or see all of the terms grouped in the list view.
                The "key terms" card view is a Bootstrap carousel. This feature is intended to be an introduction to basic financial
                terms, so that the user will have some background when they dive deeper into more complicated concepts.
            </p>
            <div class="flexColumn">
                <img class="figure figure--screen" src="https://chelly-website.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/website-images/fin-fr/prototype/cardFront.png">
                <img class="figure figure--screen" src="https://chelly-website.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/website-images/fin-fr/prototype/cardBack.png">
                <img class="figure figure--screen" src="https://chelly-website.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/website-images/fin-fr/prototype/list.png">
            </div>
            <p>
                Since many people learn differently, there is a "card" view and "list view". The button to toggle between the two different views has a background
                of our secondary color in order to make it stand out. The list view is also separated into two columns in order to organize the information.<br>
                The list was originally not grouped into subtopics, and were simply in alphabetic order. However, after receiving feedback from the class,
                we decided to split the terms up according to different financial topics.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <p>
                <h2 class="featureTitle">Feature 2: Learn About Stocks</h2>
                In the next prototype iteration, we implemented the feature of learning basic concepts about stocks. I took the information written by one of my team members
                and styled it so each section of text had its own page. We then added financial graphs so that the user could understand the information on a visual level.
            </p>
            <img class="figure figure--screen figure" src="https://chelly-website.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/website-images/fin-fr/prototype/learn.png">
            <img class="figure figure--screen figure" src="https://chelly-website.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/website-images/fin-fr/prototype/learn-hover.png">
            <p>
                Each vocabluary term is bolded, and has a hover message that reveals the definition of the word. This allows the user to understand the content more
                by giving them a broader context.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <p>
                <h2>Feature 3: Create An Account</h2>
                In the next prototype iteraction, we implemented the feature of creating an account. I designed the interface of our landing page, which includes a section 
                to sign up for an account. I also designed the login page and home page where the user can navigate between the various features. The rest of my team members
                hard coded the points system and account information.
            </p>
