            <p>
                During the summer of 2019, I worked as a UI Developer intern at <a class="link" href="https://vailsys.com" target="_blank">Vail Systems, Inc.</a>, a telephony company based in Chicago. 
                For 13 weeks, my role was a mix of UI/UX design and front-end development. I designed the user
                interface in Figma, built the foundation with Vail's custom SCSS framework, and brought the interface to life in React.
                <br><br>
                The project I worked on is called Valert - it is a notification system with an interface for Technical Account Managers (TAMs) that triggers email 
                and SMS alerts when data-specific thresholds in call centers are passed. For example, if a TAM wanted to be notified when 
                a certain company's call traffic rose to 500 calls per second, they could easily create a “rule” that tells the system to send
                these notifications when that occurs.

        <div class="section">
            <h1>Need for User-Friendliness</h1>
            <p>
                Before Valert, Vail would create rules using a CDR listener application called Trunkmon. Since Trunkmon required more technical experience, 
                TAMs would have to speak with a manager, who would then create a ticket for operations, which would then need to be approved and reviewed. 
                This process would take a few days, and was not the most user-friendly towards TAMs. Furthermore, if a TAM wanted to change or delete a rule
                at a later point, they would have to go through this whole process again.
                <br><br>
                There was an apparent need for a more efficient solution that would allow TAMs to easily create rules with little technical experience.

            <h1>Organizing the Initial Layout</h1>
            <p>
                At the start of the internship, I received a list of required features and pages from my manager. TAMs would be able to open up the application
                and see a table of every rule a TAM has made. Once a new rule was created, it would be added to the table - thus, 
                a form (or "Rule Builder") was needed so that TAMs could create new rules and add them to the table.
                With this information, I created a preliminary user-flow.
            </p>
            <img class="figure" src="https://chelly-website.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/valert/diagrams/flow.png">
            <p><br>
                I then started working on what the basic layout of the product would look like.
                I knew the main page had to be a table of rules that were already in the system, but I needed to sketch options
                on how the "Rule Builder" would interact with the main table.
            </p>
            <img class="figure" src="https://chelly-website.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/valert/sketches/01.JPG">
            <p><br>
                After sketching out some options, I created low-fidelity mockups in Figma for each one. I met with the Technical Account Manager assigned to our project
                and had him try out each prototype.<br>
            </p>
            <div class="flexRow">

            </div>
            <p><br>
                After some observation, it was apparent that the last option with the dropdown was the most efficient - users would be able to click
                on a row in the table, and that row would expand down to display more detailed information on that particular entry. With this design, users could "open"
                multiple rows and view them all at once.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h1>Building the "Rule Builder"</h1>
            After designing the initial layout of the application, I dove into more detail. With the requirements my manager gave me, 
            I had to narrow down what each field within the "Rule Builder" looked like. The user had to create a name and description for the rule,
            add a call threshold (ex. more than 500 calls per second), specify what phone number or email address they wanted to be notified with, what notification
            would look like, etc.

                Once I had some sketches, I mocked up the Rule Builder in Figma. I focused more on the placement and organization of each input field 
                rather than aesthetics.

                Once I decided on the initial layout and created a preliminary Rule Builder, I started to put the pieces together. This included 
                mocking up the rules table with placeholder data. I also mocked up the Alert Logs, which was a table that displayed every SMS or email alerts
                that had been fired for that particular rule.

            <h1>Adding Aesthetics</h1>
            <p>
                After completing the "medium fidelity" wireframes, it was time to add aesthetics. Since Valert is an internal project,
                I had a lot of freedom when it came to colors and fonts - the only users were Vail employees, thus I didn't need to
                adhere to any specific style or brand guide.
            </p><br>

            <p>
                In addition to the rules table, Rule Builder, and Alert Logs, these wireframes also include success notifications
                (that appear when an action has successfully been performed on a rule) and notification messages for deleting and saving rules.
            </p>

            <p class="caption">
                My manager prompted me to design a "safe" option - I chose blue as the primary color, and a simple font.

            <p class="caption">
                This design falls under "contemporary" - I chose a more vibrant color, rounded out the edges, and chose a font
                that was more playful yet still readable.

                The last design was intended to be "adventurous" - I picked a bright gradient, and messed around with the placement of various elements.

        <div class="section">

                I took elements from my three different aesthetic options and compiled them into one design. The primary color of this design was a bright
                blue - safe and readable enough, but still vibrant and fun. I also changed the background of the UI as well as the background color 
                for the table and Rule Builder in order to distinguish these different sections.

            <h1>What I Learned</h1>
            <p>
                My main takeaway from this internship was that development process and the design process evolve very much hand-in-hand.
                Though my primary role was designing the UI, I also contributed largely to the actual
                development of the interface in React. I found how important it was for developers and designers to communicate
                with each other, and have input in each other's work. Many developers will often avoid participating in design decisions, and
                vice versa - however these two components of a product are deeply intertwined and having open conversations as a team is essential.
