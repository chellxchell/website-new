            Freedom Link is a project I worked on for an Agile Development course. I worked in a small team as a
            software developers
            with six other students. After the end of the year, I continued to work on the project with two other
            members of the original team. <br>
            Freedom Link is a platform that offers a simple way for the early release of loved ones from the Illinois
            Department of Corrections.
            As of April 2020, more than 15% of all documented novel COVID-19 cases in Illinois could be linked to just
            one facility - the Cook County Jail.
            Freedom Link offers the chance for people to petition for the early release or furlough of their loved ones
            in the system, so that we may
            help flatten the curve and ensure the safety of inmates.<br>

        <h1>Need to Understand Release Criteria</h1>
        <p>
            With COVID-19 rampant in 2020, there was an increased need for people to petition for early release,
            furlough, or house arrest for their loved ones.
            However, this proved difficult as an inmate must meet certain criteria in order to be eligible (i.e. they
            must be vulnerable to COVID-19).
            We needed a way to help users find out what their loved one is eligible for. The idea was that the user
            would lookup their loved one using their
            government-issued IDOC number, and then see what release criteria they were eligible for.

    <div class="section">
        <h1>An Accessible Design</h1>
        We wanted to make the interface accessible and easily readable. I collaborated with a couple of my teammates to create these
        wireframes in Figma. The designs featured very large text, especially on the mobile version.

    <div class="section">
        <h1>First Demo: One-Page Application</h1>
        For our first demo with our client, a Northwestern Law Professor, we built a simple one-page application where the user could input
        their loved one's IDOC number and see the different release criteria they were eligible for.
        <div class="flexRow">
            <img class="figure-1/2" src="https://chelly-website.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/freedom-link/first-demo.png">
        </div>
        <br> Although our client liked the application, it only showed the user what release criteria their loved one was eligible for, and didn't
        offer any direction for next steps. The client wanted the user to actually be able to email the IDOC officials and file a petition to get their loved ones released.
        We spent the rest of the quarter implementing this functionality.
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h1>Implementation</h1>
        Although we were assuming that the users knew how to use the IDOC number they were given, we added an extending onboarding process for the user.
        This included FAQs, and more information on eligibility criteria. We also included an example email so that the user would know what to put in their
        message to IDOC officials.

        <div class="flexStart flexRow">
            <img class="figure-1/2 bordered"
                src="https://chelly-website.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/freedom-link/interface/Home.png">

                src="https://chelly-website.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/freedom-link/interface/example+email.png">
        </div>

        <br> Like before, the user could enter in the IDOC number to see their loved one's eligibility for release. After 
        seeing this, they could draft a petition for release in the web app, and the app will connect to their gmail account to 
        send the email to the IDOC officials.

        At the end of the project, we updated out 4-panel story for a user of Freedom Link.

        After working with a Northwestern law professor as our client, we came up with some lessons learned and defined some things
        that we would have wanted to do with the project given more time.
