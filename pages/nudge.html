        <h1 class="sectionTitle">The Problem: Encouraging Consumers to be Creators</h1>
        <p>
            Nudge is a project I worked on during my time in Northwestern's Bay Area Immersion Program.
            I worked as the only developer in a team of design and journalism students. We were tasked
            with reimagining parental controls in a technologically-dominated society. Over the course
            of the project, we strayed away from this in favor of using technology as a positive
            factor that can increase your productivity. We noticed that a lot of the users we interviewed 
            felt that they spent too much time consuming media on technology, and they weren't doing enough
            creating.
        </p>
    </div>

    <section>
        <h1 class="sectionTitle">Initial Testing</h1>
        <p>
            After some thought and discussion, we wanted to create something that would encourage users
            to start creating and be productive. We started doing initial testing with other students in the program.
        </p>
        <div class="flexRow">
            <img class="figure-1/2" src="https://chelly-website.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/bay-area/nudge/screenshots/text.PNG">
        </div>
        <p>
            We found that the test users thought this persona was too "nice" and not motivating enough. They also
            didn't like how the texts came at a seemingly random time, unprompted and unrelated to what their screen time was.
            We decided that we wanted to make a client application, so that users could customize how motivating these
            personas were, and when they would notify the user to be productive.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h1 class="sectionTitle">Basic Scenarios</h1>
        <p>
            We started working out scenarios that would prompt the persona to "nudge" the user. These scenarios are based
            on the user's screen time for various apps, and what settings they input into the client application.

        <p> I also started working out a basic interface design for the client application.</p>

        <h1 class="sectionTitle">Wireframes in Figma</h1>
        <p>After I had a basic design, I started creating wireframes in Figma.</p>
        <div class="flexRow">
            <img class="figure" src="https://chelly-website.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/bay-area/nudge/wf.png">

        </div>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h1 class="sectionTitle">React Native: Final Product</h1>
        <p>
            After the wireframes were finalized, I developed a barebones application in React Native using Expo Client. 
            A lot of the app is hardcoded, but this product is meant to be a demo for users to "get the idea."
            To avoid using a router, the navigation is done with a Controller.js component that keeps a global
            state of what page the user is on, and returns corresponding components accordingly.

            Here is a video demo introduced and narrated by other students in the program.
