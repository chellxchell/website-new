        <p>
            Trunk is a project I worked on during my time in Northwestern's Bay Area Immersion Program.
            I worked as the only developer in a team of design and journalism students. We had to pick an issue
            that we were passionate about - we decided to go with interior design, and how it pertains to Northwestern's
            campus.
            We had all experienced moving into a new apartment or house, and noticed that during moving times there were
            many
            couches, desks, and other furniture items that were left on the street. We thought that this process of
            students moving
            was not very sustainable, and wanted to approach this problem.
        </p>

        <h1 class="sectionTitle">Existing Solution: Free and For Sale</h1>
        <p>
            Currently, the way that Northwestern students buy and sell items is through Facebook's Free and For Sale
            group. This group
            is meant to be for Northwestern students, but many alumni who don't live in the area are still part of the
            group. We identified some problems
            with the group:

            After identifying these problems on Free and For Sale, we started thinking about how we could solve these
            problems
            and make the moving process easier for Northwestern students.

        <h1 class="sectionTitle">Low-Fi Prototypes: A "Better" Free & For Sale</h1>
        <p>
            Our initial prototypes and low-fidelity wireframes were focused on improving the userflow of Facebook's Free & For Sale.
            With "Dumpst Dive," users could filter and search through items on the app (functionality that is not available in F&FS).
            With "Last Call," the user could view locations of donation centers for them to drop off unsold items.

        <p>We had several approaches for user feedback.</p>

            </div>
        </div>
        <br><p>After conducting surveys, interviews, and user testing, we found some key takeaways:</p><br>
        <div class="boxContainer">
            <div class="box">
                <p class="box__title">Students want to buy used furniture</p>
            </div>
            <div class="box">
                <p class="box__title">Physically moving items is the biggest barrier</p>
            </div>
            <div class="box">
                <p class="box__title">People are always looking for items</p>
            </div>
            <div class="box">
                <p class="box__title">Connecting buyer and seller is slow and tedious</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <br>
        <p>We found that the main problem students were having was not the process of buying and selling on Free & For Sale - 
            the problem people were having was that once they found an item they wanted, it was hard to organize the logistics of picking it
            up and communicating with the buyer/seller about the item.
        </p>
        <p>
            We decided to pivot, and rather than redesigning the userflow of F&FS, we decided to abstract the process away from the user to 
            make these actions as easy and painless as possible.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h1 class="sectionTitle">Reevaluating: Journey Mapping</h1>
        <p>With a new direction in mind, we decided to make journey maps of potential users.</p>
        <img class="figure"
            src="https://chelly-website.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/bay-area/trunk/journey-maps/buyer.JPG">
        <p>
            The first journey map we did was for a buyer, before using Trunk. The buyer has to
            look through F&FS, decide what items they want, and message the seller. There's no guarantee that
            the item is still available, or that the seller will even message the user back.
        </p>
        <img class="figure"
            src="https://chelly-website.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/bay-area/trunk/journey-maps/seller.JPG">
        <p>
            We also did a journey map for a seller before using Trunk. There's no guarantee that anybody
            will message them, and they might even get lowballed.
        </p>
        <img class="figure"
            src="https://chelly-website.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/bay-area/trunk/journey-maps/both.JPG">
        <p>
            This is the journey map for potential users of Trunk. The process of negotiating and interacting with
            another student is simplified, and abstracted away.

        <h1 class="sectionTitle">React Native: Final Product</h1>
        <p>
            After the wireframes were finalized, I developed a barebones application in React Native using Expo Client. 
            A lot of the app is hardcoded, but this product is meant to be a demo for users to "get the idea."
            To avoid using a router, the navigation is done with a Controller.js component that keeps a global
            state of what page the user is on, and returns corresponding components accordingly.
