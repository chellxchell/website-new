        <h1>The Problem: Moving Furniture at Northwestern</h1>
        <p>
            Trunk is a project I worked on during my time in Northwestern's Bay Area Immersion Program.
            I worked as the only developer in a team of design and journalism students. We had to pick an issue
            that we were passionate about - we decided to go with interior design, and how it pertains to Northwestern's campus.
            We had all experienced moving into a new apartment or house, and noticed that during moving times there were many
            couches, desks, and other furniture items that were left on the street. We thought that this process of students moving
            was not very sustainable, and wanted to approach this problem.

        <p>
            Currently, the way that Northwestern students buy and sell items is through Facebook's Free and For Sale group. This group
            is meant to be for Northwestern students, but many alumni who don't live in the area are still part of the group. We identified some problems
            with the group:

            After identifying these problems on Free and For Sale, we started thinking about how we could solve these problems
            and make the moving process easier for Northwestern students.
