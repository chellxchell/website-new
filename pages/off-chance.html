                This past summer, I worked remotely as a Full Stack intern at <a class="link" href="https://www.offchance.com/" target="_blank">Off Chance</a>, a small startup based in New York. 
                Their live raffle platform, which raffles off streetwear and sneakers and gives the proceeds to charity, already had a functioning website - 
                however, the company wanted to move to a mobile platform. Our task as interns was to create the mobile app, with extended functionality, from scratch.
                <br><br>
                My role was mostly front-end development, as well as some back-end development and design. I designed the user
                interface in Figma, helped create the database in MongoDB and API using Node.js, and implemented front-end functionality in React Native.

        <div class="section">
            <h1>Extended Functionality Sketches</h1>
            Although Off Chance had a functioning website, the founder wanted to add functionality to the platform. This extended functionality included
            profile management, a wallet system, a game where users could earn additional chances, display of the top donors for the week, and more. <br>
            I based the sketches off of the web app, and added more screens for the extended functionality. I worked closely with the founder and project manager
            to get these sketches approved, then moved on to making wireframes in Figma.

            <h1>Creating the Design</h1>

            <h1>Displaying Trending Raffles</h1>
            <div class="flexRow flexStart">
                <div class="column-1/2">
                    <p class="colorPink">Design</p>
                    Originally, the app was going to just going to display all of the raffles one-by-one from top to bottom. However, after some user feedback,
                    we decided to change the home screen to have multiple horizontal carousels to display different categories of raffles. At the very top was trending
                    raffles, because this would be the most important section that users should see first. We also wanted to display cards for the Top 5 Donors of the week,
                    and for the latest winners for the most recent raffles. I made the section for these two black, so that it had a high contrast with the rest of the page and
                    it would be apparent that the section displayed users, not raffles.<br>

                <div class="column-1/2">
                    <p class="colorPink">Development</p>
                    To separate each raffles into categories, I used the raffle query route for our API that returned raffles based on a certain field in the database.
                    For trending raffles, I fetched all the raffles, and added a field in the returned JSON object for a score. I calculated the score by weighing likes by 30%
                    and entries by 70%. I then sorted the array of JSON objects by the score field and returned the first 10 entries.

            The Github repo where all the code lives is private, but the application is in the works to be published in the App Store
            and Google Play Store.
