            <p>
                I worked in a team of four as a front-end developer for Quarry, a conversational data access system that maps information requests in English onto queries against structured and unstructured data. Drawing on and analyzing data from
                both standard DBs and text repositories, Quarry provides simple answers
                for individuals who lack the technical skills to query databases. Due to the incredibly large volume of text and data that goes into these databases, 
                it becomes nearly impossible for people with limited technical experience to access the data.

            <h1>Intuitive Branding</h1>
            <h2 class="featureTitle">Logo</h2>
            <p>
                When designing a logo, I wanted to create something fun but still professional. I decided to make the word
                "Quarry" an illustration, with the "Q" resembling a search icon. I reused the design of this "Q" in the search
                bar of the interface itself, giving the design a sense of consistency.
            </p>
            <h2 class="featureTitle">Colors</h2>
            <p>
                After deciding on a logo, I wanted to pick a minimalistic color scheme that would make the interface easy to use and navigate.
                I decided on a light blue, which would make Quarry visually appealing yet not overwhelming to users.

            <h1>Wireframing</h1>
            <p>
                I began working on the interface by creating a mockup in Sketch. I wanted the path for the user to be as simple as possible - type in the desired
                dataset, enter a query, and view the results.

            <h1>Digital Prototype</h1>
            <p>
                After mocking up the interface, I started to bring it to life in React. I made two different routes - one leading to the home page 
                of the application, and another leading to the information from the query.
