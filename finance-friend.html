            <h1>A Web App for Novice Traders</h1>
            <p>
                Finance Friend is a project I worked on for a Human Computer Interaction Class. Finance Friend is a web app
                intended to help novice traders learn more about key financial concepts.
                For this project, I worked as a front-end developer with three other students to go through the research and design process
                to create the best possible user experience.

        <div class="section">
            <h1>Cryptocurrency Observations</h1>
            <p>
                We knew we wanted our app to be finance-related, so we searched for similar web apps
                that teach financial concepts. We found a crytocurrency bot online and had non-developer
                students test it out. The most common feedback was that although the interface was nice
                and simple, the bot was a "one-and-done" kind of thing and the users stated they would not
                return to the website after looking through it one time. They also stated that the information
                was not presented simply enough, and that they would not recommend it for people who don't have 
                any prior knowledge of economics. From these observations, we determined that we needed to create 
                something where the user could keep coming back and growing in their financial knowledge.

            <h1>Incentivizing Features</h1>
            <p>
                After we conducting user observations, we picked our essential features. We wanted our site to be
                simple, since it would be teaching somewhat complicated concepts. We also wanted to create a "points"
                system where the user would be able to track their learning progress. This would incentivize users
                to return to the web app instead of just visiting it once.

        <div class="section">
            <h1>"Paper Prototyping" Test</h1>
            <p>
                After we decided our features, I created a "paper" prototype to test on users while the rest of my team
                members facilitated the user testing. We printed each screen on a separate piece of physical paper and
                had a user "navigate" the site by clicking through it.
            </p>
            <div class="flexRow">

                <img class="figure" src="https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/chelly-website/website-images/fin-fr/paper-2.png">
            </div>
            <p>
                During testing, we discovered that users prefer to pick their skill level after they have
                already made an account, rather than at the beginning of creating an account. We also found that
                the user wanted a general home screen.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h1>Friendly Branding</h1>
            <p>
                As the name suggests, we wanted to design a logo that was friendly and approachable for users. We chose a blue color as 
                a neutral value, for its familiarity and professional nature.
            </p>
            <div class="flexRow">
                <img class="figure" src="https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/chelly-website/website-images/fin-fr/logo-sketches.png">
            </div>
            <p>
                We chose a rounded font, again to not intimidate users. We also chose a light pink and blue - since the darker blue
                was more professional, we wanted more pastel colors to soften to look of the interface.
            </p>

            <h1>Computer Prototype</h1>
            <p>
                <h2 class="featureTitle">Feature 1: Learn About Key Terms</h2>
                Once I had the color scheme, I started on the first feature. I created a "key terms" page which included a flash card and a list view of
                basic financial terms. The user can either learn with flashcards, or see all of the terms grouped in the list view.
                The "key terms" card view is a Bootstrap carousel. This feature is intended to be an introduction to basic financial
                terms, so that the user will have some background when they dive deeper into more complicated concepts.

            </div>
            <p>
                Since many people learn differently, there is a "card" view and "list view". The button to toggle between the two different views has a background
                of our secondary color in order to make it stand out. The list view is also separated into two columns in order to organize the information.

                <h2 class="featureTitle">Feature 2: Learn About Stocks</h2>
                In the next prototype iteration, we implemented the feature of learning basic concepts about stocks. I took the information written by one of my team members
                and styled it so each section of text had its own page. We then added financial graphs so that the user could understand the information on a visual level.

                In the next prototype iteraction, we plan to implement the feature of creating an account. I designed the interface of our landing page, which includes a section 
                to sign up for an account. I also designed the login page and home page where the user can navigate between the various features.
