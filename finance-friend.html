                    Finance Friend is a project for a Human Computer Interaction Class. Finance Friend is a web app
                    intended to help novice traders learn more about key financial concepts.
                    For this project, I worked with three other students to go through the research and design process
                    to create the best possible user experience.

                <h2 class="sub-title">Interviews and Observations</h2>
                <p class="description">
                    We knew we wanted our app to be finance-related, so we searched for similar web apps
                    that teach financial concepts. We found a crytocurrency bot online and had non-developer
                    students test it out. The most common feedback was that although the interface was nice
                    and simple, the bot was a one-and-done kind of thing and the users stated they would not
                    return to the website after looking through it one time. They also stated that the information
                    was not presented simply enough, and that they would not recommend it for people who don't have 
                    any prior knowledge of economics. From these observations, we
                    determined that we needed to create something where the user could keep coming back and growing
                    in their financial knowledge.

                <p class="description">
                    After we conducting user observations, we picked our essential features. We wanted our site to be
                    simple, since it would be teaching somewhat complicated concepts. We also wanted to create a "points"
                    system where the user would be able to track their learning progress. This would incentivize users
                    to return to the web app instead of just visiting it once.

                <h2 class="sub-title">"Paper Prototyping"</h2>
                <p class=description>
                    After we decided our features, I created a "paper" prototype to test on users while the rest of my team
                    members facilitated the user testing. We printed each screen on a separate piece of physical paper and
                    had a user "navigate" the site by clicking through it.

                <p class="description">
                    During testing, we discovered that users prefer to pick their skill level after they have
                    already made an account, rather than at the beginning of creating an account. We also found that
                    the user wanted a general home screen.

                <p class="description">
                    Once we had the paper prototype, I started to think about branding. Before thinking of a color scheme, I started thinking
                    about a logo. I brainstormed some ideas and eventually picked one concept to create in Adobe Illustrator.

                <p class="description">
                    After brainstorming, I decided on both a wordmark for the full name, and a lettermark for the abbreviation f.f. I chose a blue color
                    as a neutral value, and a rounded font in order to make the logo seem fun and playful.
                    After creating the logo, I picked the color scheme around the color of the logo.

                    <strong>Feature 1: Learn About Key Terms</strong><br>
                    Once I had the color scheme, I started on the first feature. I created a "key terms" page which included a flash card and a list view of
                    basic financial terms. The user can either learn with flashcards, or see all of the terms grouped in the list view.
                    The "key terms" card view is a Bootstrap carousel. This feature is intended to be an introduction to basic financial
                    terms, so that the user will have some background when they dive deeper into more complicated concepts.

                <p class="description">
                    Since many people learn differently, there is a "card" view and "list view". The button to toggle between the two different views has a background
                    of our secondary color in order to make it stand out. The list view is also separated into two columns in order to organize the information.

                    <strong>Feature 2: Learn About Stocks</strong><br>
                    In the next prototype iteration, we implemented the feature of learning basic concepts about stocks. I took the information written by one of my team members
                    and styled it so each section of text had its own page. We then added financial graphs so that the user could understand the information on a visual level.

                    <strong>Feature 3: Create An Account</strong><br>
                    In the next prototype iteraction, we plan to implement the feature of creating an account. I designed the interface of our landing page, which includes a section 
                    to sign up for an account. I also designed the login page and home page where the user can navigate between the various features.

                <p class="description">
                    As of now, we have implemented the first two iterations of our computer prototype for the project, and are currently working on the remaining features.
                    For our next feature, we allow the user to make an account and implement a "point system" for learning about finance.
